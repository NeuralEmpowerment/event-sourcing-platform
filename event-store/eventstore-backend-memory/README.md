# eventstore-backend-memory

In-memory backend implementing the `eventstore-core` traits. Optimized for clarity and tests, not for persistence or durability.

- Simple append/read/subscribe behavior
- Great for development and CI
- Not intended for production persistence

See `src/lib.rs` for details.
