description: Invalid fixture - slice contains business logic (should be thin adapter only)
language: typescript
version: 1.0.0

patterns:
  architecture: hexagonal-event-sourced

structure:
  domain:
    path: src/domain

validation:
  rules:
    - require_domain_folder
    - thin_slices_only
    - no_business_logic_in_slices

expected_failures:
  - "Slice 'CreateOrderCli' contains business logic (validation, calculations, state management)"
  - "Slice exceeds complexity threshold"
  - "Slice has outward dependencies to domain (should only depend on infrastructure)"
