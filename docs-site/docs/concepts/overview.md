# Shared Concepts

Core ideas that apply across the platform. Most detailed walkthroughs now live in the [Event Store](../event-store/index.md) section; use this area for cross-cutting concepts as we expand the event sourcing layer.

- Event store vs. event bus
- Aggregate patterns and stream design
- Event modelling and schema evolution
- Shared vocabulary between services

_Add new concept notes here when they are not specific to a single component._
