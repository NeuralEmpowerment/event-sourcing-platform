# Event Sourcing Platform Docs

Quick links to the areas we maintain.

## 📘 How the site is organised

- **Event Store** – architecture decisions, protocols, SDK guides, and runbooks. Start at the [Event Store overview](../event-store/index.md).
- **Docs Overview** – you are here. Use this page as a directory; add future domains (e.g., Event Sourcing services) alongside the Event Store category.

## ✍️ Editing tips

1. Keep pages short. Link to source files or ADRs rather than duplicating detail.
2. Update `_category_.json` whenever you add a folder so the sidebar stays readable.
3. Run `npm run build` inside `docs-site/` before publishing to catch broken links.

If something feels heavy, delete or consolidate it—the goal is "simple, but no simpler."
